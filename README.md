# Welcome to react-lazy-imgs

The `LazyImage` component is a versatile and lightweight solution for lazy loading images in React applications, designed to optimize performance by loading images only when they enter the viewport. It supports both React.js and React TypeScript environments, offering seamless integration into your projects.


# Features

-   **Lazy Loading**: Delays the loading of images until they are needed, improving page load times and reducing bandwidth consumption.
-   **Placeholder Support**: Allows you to specify a placeholder image that is displayed while the main image is loading, enhancing the user experience.
-   **Flexible Usage**: The component offers flexibility with optional props, enabling customization according to your specific requirements.

## Install

`yarn add react-lazy-imgs` or `npm i react-lazy-imgs`

## Simple example

    <LazyImage 
	    key={index}
	    placeholder={dummyImage}
	    src={'main-image-path'}
	    className={'your-class-name'}
	    width={"100%"}
	    height={"100%"}
     />
